Jouwdan's Scwipts for Garry's Mawd 
=================

Scripts made by Mr Ibizza(Jordie) for Garry's Mod 13+. I am not responsible for whatever or how you use these. Most of this stuff is already on the workshop uploaded by me under the alias "Jordieee ;D".To use these , go into your in-game console(~) and type "lua_openscript_cl" or "lua_openscript" .. "name.lua". Use the _cl one if it's only a client-side script.
